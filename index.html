                                    When I first entered college, I was introduced to a senior who had snuck a 3D printer into his dormitory room. 
                                    We hit it off and he taught me lots about 
                                    
                                    3D Printing, and before long, I was dreaming up ideas about what I could make. Of course, i chose to make a cool robot hand!

                                    The robot fingers move with the help of four (really strong!) servo motors, all controlled with an Arduino Uno. 
                                   
                                    The joints are made of flexible TPU while the shell is made of PLA.

                                    After assembling the hand and testing the movement with basic arduino code, 
                                    I decided to upgrade the robot hand with computer vision capabilities, and make it replicate
                                   
                                    my hand gestures! This was done with OpenCV and CVZone.

                                    We first developed the design, mechanical fastening, and manufacturing process of our product. (Yes, it works!)
                                    I also took on the role of the business development lead,
                                    
                                    and planned out the revenue model, business partnerships and social media campaigns.

                                    I also successfully pitched our business case to a panel of industry experts, competition judges and a live audience, and we managed to clinch the first place
                                    
                                    for this competition! We were featured on Channel News Asia (CNA) as well.

                                    business, and how to overcome any negative impressions on the consumer end.

                                    This was an engineering design competition, where we were tasked to design a solution that solved any problem.

                                    The idea came about when I saw the huge amount of plastic waste from takeout that would be dumped into the garbage bins outside my workplace. We decided to make 
                                   
                                    reusable lunchboxes more convenient for people to use, to encourage consumers to choose the slightly more inconvenient, but much more environmentally friendly option.

                                    My team innovated and designed a folding lunchbox concept, and I lead my team of 5 engineers through the full design and prototyping process, including CAD design, 
                                   
                                    3D Printing, mechanical fastening and assembly. I also directed market research on existing products and user needs to identify & improve business viability.

                            For this competition, we were tasked to design a satellite that would traverse the Van Allen's Belt region. We were also tasked to design an experimental payload that 
                            
                            the satellite would bring up.

                            <br>
                            We designed a novel High-Voltage Energy Generator (HEG) which would harness energy from the electrons in the Van Allen's Belt region and store it in a battery.
                           
                            The experimental payload was designed based off of a paper by Kolesnikov and Yakovlev in January 2008.

                            My team and I worked on every aspect of the satellite design, from 3D CAD of the satellite structure, sourcing of components for telemetry, communication, 
                            
                            electrical subsystems and many more. We also covered financial planning for the entire satellite mission and conducted a feasibility report.

                    Orbital is an independent software development project under NUS' School of Computing. For this project, my partner and I ideated and created Collate, a social media
                    
                    communications application that organizes users’ private messages and notifications across their various social media applications into one centralized platform.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I designed and implemented a feature to prioritize negative messages, such as product complaints, by conducting sentiment analysis on incoming private messages from 
                    Telegram and Gmail for small business owners. It would filter out any messages with negative sentiment, for the business owners to tend to first!

                    <br>
                    For one of the earlier prototypes, I developed a Python application using Flask Framework, while using Postman for testing and Heroku for deployment.
                    The NLP was done with NLTK's Vader Toolkit and SKLearn.
