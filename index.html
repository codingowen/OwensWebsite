			Hello! I'm Owen, a Mechanical Engineer from the National University of Singapore. I started college in 2021, and am now in my 2nd year!
			</p>
			<p class="content">
			I'm very fortunate that Engineering is what I do for work, school and fun. I didn't have an existential crisis trying to pick a major, I knew that I wanted to be an Engineer. While in school, I spend my time exploring cool projects, learning new things, and having lots of fun. More information about the projects I'm extra excited about can be found on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.
